The current version prints the number Pi with an accuracy of 5 digits after the decimal point.
You can change the printed numbers by editing the section .data and the _start section.
For example, to get a decimal representation of the 18th binary bit after the binary point, you need to comment in the 28th and 494th lines of code and comment out the 497th.
